# reddit-scraper

## **Synopsis**
Scripts for scraping posts and comments from Reddit using `requests` Python builtin package for retrieving content and `Beautifulsoup4` for parsing data from the retrieved content.

## 1. Motivation
I hang around Reddit a lot, and I realized that Reddit is a rich source of text data which can be used for a lot of interesting data related stuff such as sentiment analysis, topic extraction, and others which I haven't really read into yet. Ultimately, this serves as my introductory project to webscraping, especially with Reddit's dynamically structured comment section due to its possibly nested nature.
